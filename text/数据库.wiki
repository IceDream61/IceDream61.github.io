= 知识体系 =
    == Normal Form ==
    - UNF: 全放一张表里，选个key
    - 1NF $\leftarrow$ Repeating Attributes Removed: 让key成为真的key，能够唯一确定一个tuple
    - 2NF $\leftarrow$ Partial Key Dependencies Removed: 消除key-nonkey's FD
    - 3NF $\leftarrow$ Non-Key Dependencies Removed: 消除nonkey-nonkey's FD
    - BCNF $\leftarrow$ Dependencies between Keys Removed: 消除key-key's FD
    - 4NF $\leftarrow$ Dependencies between Key Sets Removed: 消除MVD
    - 5NF, PJNF 暂未理解，参考：[[ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_normal_form | wikipedia ]]
    - RNFN; SKNF; 6NF 还未看，参考：[[ http://blog.csdn.net/air_ship/article/details/19508031 | 《数据库范式 1NF，2NF，3NF，BCNF，4NF，RFNF，SKNF，5NF，6NF》 ]]
    
    == Relational Algebra ==
    - Operands: relations
    - Base Operators:
        - Union: $U$
        - Selection: $\sigma_C$
        - Projection: $\pi_L$
        - Products and Joins: $\times, \Join, \Join_C$
        - Renaming: $\rho_{<table-name, all-need-attributes>}$
    - Type:
        - Set
        - Bag
    - Extended (Nonclassical) Operators:
        - Duplicate-elimination(去重): $\delta$
        - Extended projection(可加由函数生成的新列), $\pi_L$
        - Sorting(以某些列为关键字排序): $\tau_L$
        - Grouping-and-Aggregation: $\gamma$
            - Aggregation: Apply a function to all tuples in one column, such as: SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX
            - Grouping-and-Aggregation: Group with some columns and aggregation some other columns.
        - Outerjoin: $\Join^o$
            - Join with NULL in empty cells, so that won't lose any information.
    
    == Datalog ==
    - This form of logic allows us to write queries in the relational model.
    - Rule: head $\leftarrow$ subgoals, they are atoms, and an atom consists of an predicate applied to some number of arguments.
    - IDB and EDB
    - Intensional Database and Extensional Database
    - Relational algebra and datalog

    == SQL Language ==
=== Basic Knowledge ===
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/2.png || style="width: 1000px" }}
    - SQL is case insensitive
        - Only inside quoted strings does case matter
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/1.png || style="width: 1000px" }}
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/3.png || style="width: 1000px" }}
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/4.png || style="width: 1000px" }}
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/5.png || style="width: 1000px" }}
    - {{ local:../image/数据库/6.png || style="width: 1000px" }}

=== Transaction ===
    - Enviroment: One DBMS, Many Users
    - Transaction: A transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations treated as a unit.
        - Result: Commit or Rollback
        - ACID Transaction:
            - Atomic : Whole transaction or none is done.
            - Consistent : Database constraints preserved.
            - Isolated : It appears to the user as if only one process executes at a time.
            - Durable : Effects of a process survive a crash.
        - Isolation Level:
            - `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL X = <following>`
                # SERIALIZABLE
                # REPEATABLE READ: with *phantoms*
                # READ COMMITTED: with *nonrepeatable reads*, *phantoms*
                # READ UNCOMMITTED: with *dirty reads*, *nonrepeatable reads*, *phantoms*
            - This is personal choice.
            - Read only transactions
                - `Set transaction read only;` (before set level)
                - Help system optimize performance
                - Independent of isolation level
